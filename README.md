# Project: Testing Practice – The Odin Project

### This project is part of [The Odin Project's](theodinproject.com) JavaScript curriculum. It focuses on learning how to write unit tests using Jest, applying Test-Driven Development (TDD), and building confidence in writing reliable code.

## What I Built
A basic set of functions tested using Jest
Applied TDD workflow: Write test ➝ Write code ➝ Refactor ➝ Repeat
Examples included:
  Caesar Cipher <br/>
  Array Analyzer <br/>
  Capitalize function <br/>
  Reverse string <br/>
  Calculator object with basic arithmetic

## Concepts Practiced
Unit testing with Jest <br/>
Pure functions <br/>
Writing meaningful test cases <br/>
Validating inputs <br/>
Thinking in small, testable units <br/>
